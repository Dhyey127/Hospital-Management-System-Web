## Functionality

- Availablity Schedule for doctor feature is not implemented. I wanted to implement slot based availablity for the doctor but due to lack of time i have simply appointed patient to a doctor at a particular appointement time.
- You can search patient, doctors & departments by their name, and you can filter doctor based on their specializtion in doctors tab
- Yoi can also set pagination limit by changing rows per page of table
